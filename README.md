# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a web scraper that extracts text data from a target website. The extracted strings are often unstructured, making them difficult to read or analyze. This project uses regular expressions to clean and format these strings, enhancing readability and usability. Furthermore, to improve the user experience, the program includes a feature that triggers a pop-up notification on the local machine once the scraping and processing tasks are completed.

# Features

**1. Automated Web Scraping:** Extracts text data from a specified website.

**2. Regex-Based String Cleaning:** Uses regular expressions to structure and clean the scraped data.

**3. Local Pop-Up Notifications:** Displays a notification on the user's desktop when the task is completed.
